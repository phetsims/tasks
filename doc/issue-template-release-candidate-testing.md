Note: This template is still under development & discussion and is not ready for general usage.

OK I published a release candidate here:
RELEASE_CANDIDATE_URL

And the test matrix is here:

Aside from the test matrix (linked above), please run the following tests:

- [ ] test a few platforms with ?ea
- [ ] test the iframe on Firefox (and specify version tested) (iframe is here: http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/html/forces-and-motion-basics/1.1.0-rc.1/forces-and-motion-basics_en-iframe.html )
- [ ] test the iframe on IE (and specify version tested)
- [ ] test that it runs offline on one or two platforms
- [ ] check the pointer areas using http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/html/forces-and-motion-basics/1.1.0-rc.1/forces-and-motion-basics_en.html?showPointerAreas on one or two platforms
- [ ] test with ?dev and see if the layout bounds look good on one platform using using http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phet/dev/html/forces-and-motion-basics/1.1.0-rc.1/forces-and-motion-basics_en.html?dev

Thanks!

Reassigning to @ariel-phet to prioritize and reassign.
