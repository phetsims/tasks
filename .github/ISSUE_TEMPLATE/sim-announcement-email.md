#Instructions
1. Create an issue utilizing the templated content below that matches the sim publication as a starting point (delete the remaining templates)
1. Assign all stakeholders that need to sign-off on the email content before it is sent to users.
1. Assign @oliver-phet when the email content is ready to be built. (Optionally) request a test send to you or others.

## Questions to consider when writing

- Should funding be acknowledged?
- Should credit be given to external contributors?
- Should this only be sent to a subset of opted-in PhET user? (e.g. only 'Math' 'Teachers'/'Teacher Educator/Coach')
- Is there a strict send date? (must be sent before X)
- Translated? (typically, yes - we send in both English and Spanish. But indicate if the email should _not_ be translated)

#Full publication (strict port)

{{sim name}} now in HTML5!

{{sim description}}
The new {{sim name}} has all the same features as the original but with seamless performance on all your classroom devices.

{{optional additional sim description}}

{{learning goals, typically the same as sim page}}
Sample Learning Goals
- Learning goal 1
- Learning goal 2
- Learning goal 3

{{Inclusive Features, if applicable}}
Movement Features
- (Touch devices) Challenge yourself to move your hands proportionally by maintaining each ratio while moving the sim's hands from low to high on the screen
- (Alternative Input) Move the sim’s hands “rhythmically” to keep proportion by using the keyboard to control the left and right hands simultaneously.

#Full publication (port, significant redesign)

Announcing {{sim name}}!

We are excited to announce our latest simulation, {{sim name}}! 

{{language around new features}}
The HTML5 version of Vector Addition introduces several new features, including a polar coordinate mode, an introductory screen for 1D vectors, the ability to simultaneously compare two vector sets on the Lab screen, and a screen focusing on vector equations which has been published as a standalone-sim.
With 4 screens and many powerful new capabilities, we are very excited about the fully redesigned HTML5 Masses and Springs simulation! You can now vary the spring length, display velocity and acceleration vectors, explore forces, experiment in a new lab screen, and more.

{{optional, additional sim description}}
In the new Standard Form screen, you can identify the vertex, axis of symmetry, and roots of a parabola. Head over to the Vertex Form screen and interact with the graph or equation in vertex form. Finally, interact with the focus and vertex in the Focus & Directrix screen.

#Full publication (brand new sim)

Announcing {{sim name}}!

{{sim description}}
We are excited to announce an our latest simulation, {{sim name}}! This sim allows students to explore the properties and behavior of sound by seeing (and hearing!) the resulting waves. Students can also adjust properties of the speakers, investigate two-source interference and reflection, or even see the effects of a vacuum.

#Prototype

Announcing {{sim name}}!

We are excited to announce a our latest simulation prototype, {{sim name}}! This sim allows students to explore the properties and behavior of sound by seeing (and hearing!) the resulting waves. Students can also adjust properties of the speakers, investigate two-source interference and reflection, or even see the effects of a vacuum.

_Keep in mind: Prototypes may not include all planned features and have undergone limited testing. If you find bugs, please report them to us!_
